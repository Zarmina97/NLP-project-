# Success Prediction of Instagram Posts
-------------------------------
The main goal is to predict the number of likes given a post by building machine learning models. These models will use the meta-features, Natural Language Processing features & CV features to make such predictions.

# Overview
-------------------------------
The University of Bologna (UniBo) Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. In this project, we utilised the dataset scrapped from Intagram API for the successfull prediction of Instagram posts.

Five different methods (LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest,MLP,SVM) were trained and evaluated on the dataset. Our results show that the XGboost roduces the best results in terms of R2 Score on the test set.
